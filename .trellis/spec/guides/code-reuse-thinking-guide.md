# Code Reuse Thinking Guide

> **Purpose**: Stop and think before creating new code - does it already exist?

---

## The Problem

**Duplicated code is the #1 source of inconsistency bugs.**

When you copy-paste or rewrite existing logic:
- Bug fixes don't propagate
- Behavior diverges over time
- Codebase becomes harder to understand

---

## Before Writing New Code

### Step 1: Search First

```bash
# Search for similar function names
grep -r "functionName" .

# Search for similar logic
grep -r "keyword" .
```

### Step 2: Ask These Questions

| Question | If Yes... |
|----------|-----------|
| Does a similar function exist? | Use or extend it |
| Is this pattern used elsewhere? | Follow the existing pattern |
| Could this be a shared utility? | Create it in the right place |
| Am I copying code from another file? | **STOP** - extract to shared |

---

## Common Duplication Patterns

### Pattern 1: Copy-Paste Functions

**Bad**: Copying a validation function to another file

**Good**: Extract to shared utilities, import where needed

### Pattern 2: Similar Components

**Bad**: Creating a new component that's 80% similar to existing

**Good**: Extend existing component with props/variants

### Pattern 3: Repeated Constants

**Bad**: Defining the same constant in multiple files

**Good**: Single source of truth, import everywhere

## When to Abstract

**Abstract when**:
- Same code appears 3+ times
- Logic is complex enough to have bugs
- Multiple people might need this

**Don't abstract when**:
- Only used once
- Trivial one-liner
- Abstraction would be more complex than duplication

---

## After Batch Modifications

When you've made similar changes to multiple files:

1. **Review**: Did you catch all instances?
2. **Search**: Run grep to find any missed
3. **Consider**: Should this be abstracted?

## Gotcha: Asymmetric Mechanisms Producing Same Output

**Problem**: When two different mechanisms must produce the same file set (e.g., recursive directory copy for init vs. manual `files.set()` for update), structural changes (renaming, moving, adding subdirectories) only propagate through the automatic mechanism. The manual one silently drifts.

**Symptom**: Init works perfectly, but update creates files at wrong paths or misses files entirely.

**Prevention checklist**:
- [ ] When migrating directory structures, search for ALL code paths that reference the old structure
- [ ] If one path is auto-derived (glob/copy) and another is manually listed, the manual one needs updating
- [ ] Add a regression test that compares outputs from both mechanisms

## Config/Input Shape Gotcha: Structured Secrets in `.env`

**Problem**: Putting structured JSON with special characters (for example `scrypt$...` password hashes) directly into `.env` looks convenient, but env loaders, shell interpolation, platform differences, and container/runtime parsing can silently rewrite the value before application code sees it.

**Symptom**:
- The same hash works when stored in a JSON file, but login fails when the user pastes it into `.env`
- Validation reports malformed JSON or invalid hash shape even though the source text looks correct
- Docker `-e` usage works, but local `.env` startup fails

**Prevention checklist**:
- [ ] Do not store structured auth/user lists in `.env`; keep `.env` for scalar flags and secrets
- [ ] Move arrays/objects with user-managed content into dedicated files under the app data directory
- [ ] If you are replacing one config key with a file-based source, search docs, examples, and architecture notes together
- [ ] When a config value contains `$`, quotes, or JSON escaping, assume there is a transport-layer risk and test the exact runtime path

## Checklist Before Commit

- [ ] Searched for existing similar code
- [ ] No copy-pasted logic that should be shared
- [ ] Constants defined in one place
- [ ] Similar patterns follow same structure
